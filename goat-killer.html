    <h2>Easy goat-meat to cook</h2>
    <p> <strong>Goat meat</strong> is a healthy, tasty and sustainable source of meat. It tastes like lamb and also like beef. It’s mild in flavor, a little sweet. You can season them with whatever you’d like – below is a homemade seasoning that I use.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound goat loin chops approx. 6 small chops</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil or fat of choice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt adjust to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon amchur dried mango powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the chops to a bowl with the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Marinate overnight if possible.</li>
    <li>Allow the chops to come to room temperature before broiling.</li>
    <li>Place a small wire rack on top of a foil-lined pan, then place the chops on top.</li>
    <li>Turn on the broiler.</li>
    <li>Broil the chops 4-5 inches from the heat source for ten minutes.</li>
    <li>The goat should register 145°F using a meat thermometer and will be medium-rare.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before eating.</li>
</ol>
